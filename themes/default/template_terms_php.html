We also reserve the right to charge a fee for the returned payment where We have incurred costs in dealing with the event, block the User&rsquo;s Account, and to withhold the delivery of any Won Items until the payment of all outstanding invoice amounts, including any fees, have been received in full and cleared.</li>
            <li>Your Coin Balance may only be used to pay the Bid Price for Bids You place. In the event of a Win, You may only pay for the Item that has been  by direct payment to Us, not from Your Coin Balance.</li>
            <li>We may also block access to Your Account and / or amend a User&rsquo;s Account Balance if We have reason to suspect fraudulent behaviour or a breach of these Terms and Conditions. Where We reasonably believe that a User has intentionally exploited any of Our offers or Our Website in general, We reserve the right to remove all of the User&rsquo;s Credit Balance and charge the User directly for any Bids that have been placed in breach of these terms.</li>
            <li>Any fees or charges that We impose as a result of fraudulent activity, chargeback events or any other serious breach of these Terms and Conditions will become recoverable as a debt where the User does not make payment within 28 days of the invoice being served.</li>

        </li>
        <li>HOW AUCTIONS WITH HAPPYBID WORK
          <ol>
            <li>Auctions on Our Website follow a very simple structure and in order to provide You with the knowledge required to apply skill and judgement in the Auctions, We provide You with the following data for each and every Auction on Our Website:
              <ol>
                <li>The Item&rsquo;s RRP – this information is provided to the best of Our knowledge and is usually provided by the manufacturer of each Item. We cannot guarantee that the RRP is correct but will always use Our best endeavours to ensure that the RRP is as accurate as possible.</li>
                <li>The Bid Price – this is the amount it will cost You, in Coins, to place a Bid for the Item. The Bid Price varies between each of the Auctions, so check this amount prior to placing each Bid to ensure that You are comfortable with the Bid Price.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>A Unique Bid is deemed to be a Bid that is the only Bid placed for a specific amount within a specific Auction. If a further Bid is placed by another User for the exact same amount, then both Bids are deemed to be no longer Unique (they both become Non-Unique Bids).</li>
            <li>In the event that there is no Unique Bid in the Auction when it closes, the auction will be reopened for a futher 10 bids, this will continue until a winner is produced.</li>
            <li>For an Auction to close the Bids Remaining must be 0. An Auction is initially created by Us with a defined amount of Bids Remaining.</li>
            <li>Upon completion of an Auction, the Winning User will receive confirmation of their Win by email. Refer to section 9 for full details of the checking procedure for Auction Winners. The auction will then  reveal all of the Bid amounts placed in the Auction in an anonymous format so that Users will be able to see how their Bids performed and learn from the patterns within the Auction for next time, these will remain available until we decide to remove the closed auction.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to:
              <ol>
                <li>Suspend or terminate an Auction at any time in the event of technical problems or to investigate suspected irregular or fraudulent activity;</li>
                <li>Limit the Auctions that You may participate in (this is generally only for Our beginner or free Bid Auctions).</li>
                <li>Change the item of an auction if we feel our users do not have sufficent interest in the product and it will take too long to come to an end. We will only replace the item with something of equal or greater value however and therefor all bids made so far will stand.</li>
                <li>Remove an auction if we feel it does not benefit our users and has not had sufficent interest. In this case all bids will be recredited to the users accounts who placed bids.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Further information about how the Auctions work in a simpler guide can be found in the <a href="howitworks.php">How It Works</a> sections of Our Website.</li>
            <li>For the avoidance of doubt, any advice or help articles appearing on Our Website are intended solely as suggestions for techniques and should not be construed as providing a solution to Winning any specific Auction. We accept no liability whatsoever for any actions taken by a User as a result of reading, or being informed about, any of the advice or written materials available on Our Website.</li>
            <li>The winner will pay HappyBid their winning bid, if the winning bid is less than &pound;0.50 the winner does not need to pay the winning bid amount.</li>
            <li>Guaranteed Winner Auctions end at a set date and time or when the bids remain counter hits 0, whichever occurs first.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>CONFIRMATION OF THE WINNER&rsquo;S DETAILS
          <ol>
            <li>It is a condition precedent to formation of a Contract between the Winning User and Us that the telephone number held by Us at the time of Winning the Auction is valid and that the User can be reached by calling it. In the event that the telephone number is not correct, the Contract cannot be formed and the Win will be forfeited.</li>
            <li>Upon completion of an Auction, the Winner will be required to confirm their registered telephone number by receiving a text from Us. We will attempt to call or text the Winner&rsquo;s registered telephone number within 2 working days of the Auction ending and may request that the User confirms some details from their Account in order to verify the User. In the event that the telephone number on file has voicemail, We will leave a message requesting that the User returns Our call to verify their Account. Alternatively, the Winner may call or email Us to request a call back. In any event, the only acceptable methods of verification is for Us to call and/or text You on the telephone number that You have provided as part of Your User Account details.</li>
            <li>The Winner will have 14 days to confirm to HappyBid their information, if the Winner does not confirm within this time period HappyBid will presume the User does not want the prize and it will be forfeited by the User.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>DELIVERY
          <ol>
            <li>We deliver the Item Won free of charge within mainland UK unless otherwise stated.  Specific details are available by contacting Us. Certain Items may not be delivered free of charge due to the practicalities, for example an Auction for a car may not be delivered to the Winner. In these cases We may, at Our sole discretion, pay for Your travel expenses to collect the Item Won either from Us or from Our supplier.</li>
            <li>Items that have been Won on Our Website will normally be dispatched to the Winner within 3 working days of Contract formation and payment of the Auction ending price by the User. In exceptional circumstances We may be unable to honour this timescale and the dispatch may be slightly later, We will always contact the Winner to inform them of any delays to the delivery.</li>
            <li>You will receive a dispatch confirmation via email to the registered email address when the Item has been dispatched. We may at Our sole discretion choose to use a courier or parcel delivery service that utilises a parcel tracking facility, where this is the case, You will also receive the courier&rsquo;s details and the parcel tracking number in Your dispatch email. Tracking is provided purely in accordance with the courier&rsquo;s own Terms and Conditions which may be found on the courier&rsquo;s Website.</li>
            <li>We may, at Our sole discretion, offer the Winner the opportunity to customise their Item before they receive it. For example if a User Wins a car through Our Website, We would normally allow the User to choose the colour and other free options; We may also allow the User to add other optional extras to the car at the User&rsquo;s own expense prior to ordering the car. Whilst this provides a better value product to the User, the above delivery timescales cannot be honoured for such Items. Further, the User agrees that any delivery period(s) quoted by Our suppliers in such cases would be acceptable to the User.</li>
            <li>In some rare cases the item we auction may be out of stock with our supplier, if we cannot obtain stock we will either offer the winner an alternative item or a cash payment to their PayPal account to the RRP value of the auction.</li>
            <li>Any dispatch or delivery times quoted are estimates only and We cannot guarantee any exact dates or delivery timescales in any way. You agree that any delays to delivery imposed upon Us by Our couriers or the like are out of Our control, and that such delays would be acceptable to You.</li>
            <li>Any Items that have been damaged during transport or packaging that is damaged upon delivery must be reported to Us within one working day of receiving the delivery. Failure to do so will waive any rights You may have to claim for replacement of a damaged Item.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>RETURNS AND CANCELLATIONS / CONSUMER RIGHTS
          <ol>
            <li>The Items that are the subject of Auctions on Our Website vary hugely; for this reason We are unable to offer a standard period within which You may return a faulty Item. Our policy is therefore to assess each Item on an individual basis and apply a &lsquo;reasonable time&rsquo; principle in accordance with English Law. If We determine that Your Item has developed a fault within what We consider to be a reasonable time, We will arrange for the Item to be collected from You at Our expense and a repaired or replacement Item will be returned to You within a reasonable time, again at Our expense. Where We are unable to provide a repaired or replacement Item, We reserve the right to issue a full refund of the purchase price, which will constitute full consideration for the Item. Where the Item appears to have been the subject of abuse, accidental damage or misuse We reserve the right to refuse to provide a repaired or replacement Item and to charge You for the cost of Us collecting the Item from You and returning the Item to You. For Items which store data, it is Your responsibility to backup Your own data prior to the Item being returned; any repaired or replacement Item will be returned to You without any of Your personal data or files installed on same. We do not offer a data recovery service of any type.</li>
            <li>Media Items are not covered by the return policy above where they have been opened or have had their seal broken. Media Items will only be eligible for return in exchange for a replacement product if they are found to be faulty. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, &lsquo;Media Items&rsquo; include without limitation; audio products, video products; computer software or any similarly licensed Item. Box sets or sets of any sort may only be returned in their entirety; partial refunds for individual components from within a full set will not be issued.</li>
            <li>Any refunds due to You will usually be paid by PayPal, made payable to the Account holder the user has purchased Coins from.</li>
            <li>You may cancel your Account with us at anytime by writing to us, in doing so any  coins used will not be refunded but coins unused may be refunded at our discretion, minus any PayPal fees incurred by us. By cancelling your account you lose your right to win any items on HappyBid.</li>
            <li>Your statutory rights are not affected by this section of these Terms and Conditions.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>SETTING OFF / WITHHOLDING PAYMENT / RETENTION OF TITLE
          <ol>
            <li>In the case of an outstanding payment of any kind and / or chargeback against the User, any Items delivered to the User will remain the property of HappyBid until such time as the amounts owed to Us are paid in full. During this time, You undertake to store the Item separately from Your other possessions and not take beneficial use of the Item until such time as the payment has been received and cleared in full.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
